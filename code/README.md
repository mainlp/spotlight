# Code

This folder contains the code of the Additional Material for "What's the Difference? Supporting Users in Identifying the Effects of Prompt and Model Changes Through Token Patterns"

## Structure

There are three main folders

- Benchmarks: Code to generate the data for each benchmark and the code for the (soft) precision/recall/f1 score evaluation
- Token pattern methods: Implementations of the token pattern methods presented in Section 4.
- User study: Code for the web application that runs the user study. We provide both backend and client to document the instructions to the participants and the study process in detail.

All code is written in Python. Each folder contains a requirement.txt that specifies the necessary libraries. Some folders contain additional README.md files where more details are necessary.

## AI Usage Disclaimer

Selected parts of the code in this repository have been written with the support of code completions of an AI coding assistant, namely GitHub Copilot. Completions were mostly single lines up to a few lines of code and were always checked carefully to ensure their functionality and safety. Furthermore, we did our best to avoid accepting code completions that would be incompatible with the license of our code or could be regarded as plagiarism.
