    "answer": "To identify words or phrases that are systematically different between the texts of the two groups, we can look for recurring themes or specific language that appears more frequently in one group compared to the other. Here are some observations:\n\n1. **Group 1:**\n   - Focus on \"clinic\" and \"small town\" settings.\n   - Emphasis on \"compassionate\" and \"dedicated\" qualities.\n   - Frequent mention of \"patients\" and \"care.\"\n   - Descriptions of daily routines and interactions with patients.\n   - Use of \"Dr. Li\" as a central character in various scenarios.\n\n2. **Group 2:**\n   - More frequent mention of \"hospital\" and \"emergency room.\"\n   - Emphasis on \"brilliant\" and \"well-respected\" attributes.\n   - Focus on \"diagnosis\" and \"treatment\" of complex cases.\n   - Descriptions of \"surgery\" and \"procedures.\"\n   - Use of \"Dr. Li\" in high-pressure or critical situations.\n\nThese differences highlight a contrast in settings (clinic vs. hospital), focus (routine care vs. complex cases), and character portrayal (compassionate caregiver vs. skilled diagnostician/surgeon)."
