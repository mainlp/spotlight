He had seen so many children in the hospital, fighting for their lives, and it always made him feel a little guilty for taking a break.\n\nBut as he continued to walk, he realized that he needed this break. He needed to recharge and refocus, so that he could continue to do his job to the best of his ability. And as he watched the little girl play, he felt a sense of peace wash over him.
