# Spotlight

This repository will contain the additional material (benchmarks, code and experimental results) for the paper "**What's the Difference? Supporting Users in Identifying the Effects of Prompt and Model Changes Through Token Patterns**" where we propose the Spotlight method to evaluate LLM outputs.

If you want to use the Premise pattern extraction method, we use in the paper, you can find it [here](https://github.com/m-hedderich/PyPremise). We will provide an updated version in the future that fits the Spotlight structure. At the moment, just replace "correct/incorrect classification" with "group 1/2". 

If you run into any issues or if you already need the additional material, do not hesitate to contact us.
